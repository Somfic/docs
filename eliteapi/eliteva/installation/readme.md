# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before installing EliteVa, make sure you have purchased and installed VoiceAttack which you can find [here.](https://voiceattack.com/Default.aspx#download-1)

VoiceAttack does have a free version, but to make use of the full functionality of EliteVA, you will need to purchase a license for $10.00 (additional sales tax may apply).

Once VoiceAttack is properly installed, be sure to check the box labeled "Enable Plugin Support" found under the "General" tab of the Voice Attack Options menu.\

You will also need a tool to open and extract .zip archives. I highly recommend WinRAR a powerful free tool that is very easy to use. You can download WinRAR for free at this [link](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) by clicking the blue download button.\

With these prerequisite steps complete, download EliteVA at the link below.

## Download EliteVA

EliteVA can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/EliteAPI/EliteVA/releases/download/v3.0.0-alpha1055/EliteVA.zip)

## Install EliteVA
The download link above will give you the EliteVA.zip archive in your Downloads folder by default.

After the archive has finished downloading, open File Explorer and navigate to the .zip file you just downloaded.

Right click the EliteVA.zip file you downloaded and select "Cut". Next, navigate to your VoiceAttack install directory.\
By default this is located at C:/Program Files (x86)/VoiceAttack

In this folder there should be another folder named "Apps" if not, create it now.\ 

Open the Apps folder, and create a new folder in here named EliteVA.\

Open the EliteVA folder you just created. Right click anywhere in this folder and select, "Paste".

The EliteVA.zip file should now appear.\

Right click on the EliteVA.zip file and select "Extract Here" or otherwise extract the contents of the archive into this folder.\

## Checking Your Work
You should have the following files in the VoiceAttack/Apps/EliteVA directory:\
EliteVA.dll\
A new folder named Mappings\

Once you have the above files in the correct directory as described above, close down VoiceAttack if it is still running.\

Reopen VoiceAttack.\

If the install is performed correctly VoiceAttack should show some set of messages along the lines of:\
"Plugin support enabled."\
"Initializing EliteAPI vX.X.X.X"\
"EliteAPI has started"\
"Plugin 'EliteVA' initialized."

If these messages do not appear in VoiceAttack, double check that you followed the installation guide correctly and if problems continue to persist contact Somfic on [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/jwpFUPZ) for assistance.

## Best Practices
Now that you have EliteVA properly installed, it is recommended to always start VoiceAttack prior to loading up Elite: Dangerous to ensure the API and any associated VoiceAttack profiles track the game's events as accurately as possible.\
